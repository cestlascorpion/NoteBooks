# WebRTC 学习笔记

## Concepts

>- real-time communications meets web
>- technology stack embedded in browser for making low cost, high quality p2p audio, video and data communication
>- makes real time multimedia communication possible across different platforms and devices

WebRTC applications need to do several things:

>- Get streaming audio, video or other data.
>- Get network information such as IP addresses and ports, and exchange this with other WebRTC clients (known as peers) to enable connection, even through NATs and firewalls.
>- Coordinate signaling communication to report errors and initiate or close sessions.
>- Exchange information about media and client capability, such as resolution and codecs.
>- Communicate streaming audio, video or data.

To acquire and communicate streaming data, WebRTC implements the following APIs:

>- `MediaStream`: get access to data streams, such as from the user's camera and microphone.
>- `RTCPeerConnection`: audio or video calling, with facilities for encryption and bandwidth management.
>- `RTCDataChannel`: peer-to-peer communication of generic data.

## Key APIs

>- `MediaStream`(aka `getUserMedia`): helps in getting access to user's mic and cam

`getUserMedia` is available in Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Edge. Take a look at the cross-browser demo at demo and Chris Wilson's amazing examples using `getUserMedia` as input for Web Audio.

>- `RTCPeerConnection`: helps in establishing p2p connection for AV communication

`RTCPeerConnection` is in Chrome (on desktop and for Android), Opera (on desktop and in the latest Android Beta) and in Firefox. A word of explanation about the name: after several iterations, `RTCPeerConnection` is currently implemented by Chrome and Opera as `webkitRTCPeerConnection` and by Firefox as `mozRTCPeerConnection`. Other names and implementations have been deprecated. When the standards process has stabilized, the prefixes will be removed. There's an ultra-simple demo of Chromium's RTCPeerConnection implementation at GitHub and a great video chat application at apprtc.appspot.com. This app uses adapter.js, a JavaScript shim, maintained Google with help from the WebRTC community, that abstracts away browser differences and spec changes.

>- `RTCDataChannel`: helps in p2p data communication

`RTCDataChannel` is supported by Chrome, Opera and Firefox. Check out one of the data channel demos at GitHub to see it in action.

## Summary

>- Acuqiring audio and video -> getUserMedia
>- Communicating audio and video -> getUserMedia + RTCPeerConnection
>- Communicating arbitrary data -> RTCDataChannel + RTCPeerConnection
>- more info see video on youtube
